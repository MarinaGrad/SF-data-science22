    "How to use placeholders to bind values in SQL queries\n",

An SQL statement may use one of two kinds of placeholders: question marks (qmark style) or named placeholders (named style). For the qmark style, parameters must be a sequence. For the named style, it can be either a sequence or dict instance. The length of the sequence must match the number of placeholders, or a ProgrammingError is raised.

For the named style, it can be either a sequence or dict instance. The length of the sequence must match the number of placeholders, or a ProgrammingError is raised.

    "How to create and use row factories\n",
    "By default, sqlite3 represents each row as a tuple. If a tuple does not suit your needs, you can use the sqlite3.Row class or a custom row_factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "While row_factory exists as an attribute both on the Cursor and the Connection, it is recommended to set Connection.row_factory, so all cursors created from the connection will use the same row factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Row provides indexed and case-insensitive named access to columns, with minimal memory overhead and performance impact over a tuple. To use Row as a row factory, assign it to the row_factory attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "con = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\n",
    "con.row_factory = sqlite3.Row\n",
    "Queries now return Row objects:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "res = con.execute(\"SELECT 'Earth' AS name, 6378 AS radius\")\n",
    "row = res.fetchone()\n",
    "row.keys()\n",
    "['name', 'radius']\n",
    "row[0]         # Access by index.\n",
    "'Earth'\n",
    "row[\"name\"]    # Access by name.\n",
    "'Earth'\n",
    "row[\"RADIUS\"]  # Column names are case-insensitive.\n",
    "6378\n",
    "You can create a custom row_factory that returns each row as a dict, with column names mapped to values:\n",
    "\n",
    "def dict_factory(cursor, row):\n",
    "    fields = [column[0] for column in cursor.description]\n",
    "    return {key: value for key, value in zip(fields, row)}\n",
    "Using it, queries now return a dict instead of a tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "con = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\n",
    "con.row_factory = dict_factory\n",
    "for row in con.execute(\"SELECT 1 AS a, 2 AS b\"):\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "{'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "The following row factory returns a named tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "from collections import namedtuple\n",
    "\n",
    "def namedtuple_factory(cursor, row):\n",
    "    fields = [column[0] for column in cursor.description]\n",
    "    cls = namedtuple(\"Row\", fields)\n",
    "    return cls._make(row)\n",
    "namedtuple_factory() can be used as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "con = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\n",
    "con.row_factory = namedtuple_factory\n",
    "cur = con.execute(\"SELECT 1 AS a, 2 AS b\")\n",
    "row = cur.fetchone()\n",
    "row\n",
    "Row(a=1, b=2)\n",
    "row[0]  # Indexed access.\n",
    "1\n",
    "row.b   # Attribute access.\n",
    "2\n",
    "With some adjustments, the above recipe can be adapted to use a dataclass, or any other custom class, instead of a namedtuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "Transaction control\n",
    "The sqlite3 module does not adhere to the transaction handling recommended by PEP 249.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the connection attribute isolation_level is not None, new transactions are implicitly opened before execute() and executemany() executes INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or REPLACE statements; for other statements, no implicit transaction handling is performed. Use the commit() and rollback() methods to respectively commit and roll back pending transactions. You can choose the underlying SQLite transaction behaviour — that is, whether and what type of BEGIN statements sqlite3 implicitly executes – via the isolation_level attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "If isolation_level is set to None, no transactions are implicitly opened at all. This leaves the underlying SQLite library in autocommit mode, but also allows the user to perform their own transaction handling using explicit SQL statements. The underlying SQLite library autocommit mode can be queried using the in_transaction attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The executescript() method implicitly commits any pending transaction before execution of the given SQL script, regardless of the value of isolation_level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changed in version 3.6: sqlite3 used to implicitly commit an open transaction before DDL statements. This is no longer the case.\n",
